CDataFile
=========

Almost as soon as your application becomes something more than "Hello World",
you find yourself in need of a means to persistently store configuration
settings or other data. The registry is generally a bad place for more than a
few settings because of it's limited size and difficulty of use. The common
method is to use some form of configuration file.

CDataFile is a C++ object who's purpose is to aid you in reading and writing to
configuration files. It generally tries to be compatible with standard Windows
.ini files, although it has some features that, if used, will break that
compatiblity. (namely non-standard comment indicators and quoted key/value
values).

While I'm not a huge fan of std::string (and honestly, not all that familiar
with it), I felt that it would be the best choice here. It's certainly portable
and does not rely on MFC or any other third party libraries. The lack of
features in std::string made me nearly regret that choice early on.

Ample documentation for the class exists within the source code and the
provided test project.


Primary Features List

 - No reliance on windows system calls. You should be able to use this code,
   with minor modifications, in your linux applications as well as your
   windows.
